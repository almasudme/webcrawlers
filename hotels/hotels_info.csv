59,The Tony Hotel South Beach,4.5,2719,"801 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33139-5807",#27 of 232 hotels in Miami Beach,"The Tony Hotel South Beach was originally designed and built in 1939 by L. Murray Dixon, a master architect responsible for many of the Art Deco buildings that line Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive. Dixon’s signature style, embodied in this hotel, included streamlined curves, jutting towers, window “eyebrows,” and neon. Originally named The Tiffany (and subsequently renamed The Hotel of South Beach), the hotel’s rooftop “Tiffany” spire is an historic landmark, towering majestically over Collins Avenue for more than 80 years. In 1985, legendary placemaker Tony Goldman visited South Beach for the first time and fell in love. He saw past the blight and dilapidated buildings that plagued South Beach at the time and envisioned the American Riviera. He spent the next 27 years of his life leading the renaissance of South Beach, fighting to preserve its history while also envisioning its future as a pedestrian destination where people from all walks of life could enjoy its natural beauty in an inclusive community. Tony Goldman bought and methodically restored the hotel, among other properties, and in 1998 enlisted fashion designer Todd Oldham to infuse the hotel with the rich colors, shapes, and textures emblematic of the Art Deco era. The renaming of the hotel as The Tony Hotel South Beach in 2022, on the tenth anniversary of his passing, was a fitting tribute to Tony Goldman by his family, who still own and operate the hotel to this day.","['Pool', 'Internet', 'Free Internet', 'Free Wifi', 'Beachfront', 'Wheelchair access', 'Restaurant', 'Bar/Lounge', 'Wifi', 'Public Wifi', 'Dry Cleaning', 'Non-smoking rooms', 'Business center', 'Fitness center', 'Concierge', 'Air conditioning', 'Multilingual Staff', 'Accessible rooms', 'Non-smoking hotel', 'Safe', 'Rooftop Bar', 'Rooftop Pool', 'Heated pool', 'Flatscreen TV', 'Rooftop Terrace', 'Poolside Bar', 'Outdoor pool', 'Parking', 'Facilities for Disabled Guests', 'Housekeeping', 'Baggage Storage', 'Bathrobes', 'Blackout Curtains', 'Bottled Water', 'Coffee / Tea Maker', 'Desk', 'Doorperson', 'English', 'Fitness / Spa Locker Rooms', 'Complimentary Instant Cofffee', 'Complimentary Toiletries', '24-Hour Front Desk', 'Hair Dryer', 'Iron', 'Outdoor Furniture', 'Pool / Beach Towels', 'Pool with View', 'Private Check-in / Check-out', 'Paid Private Parking Nearby', '24-Hour Security', 'Spanish', 'Street Parking', 'Sun Loungers / Beach Chairs', 'Sun Terrace', 'Sun Umbrellas', 'Taxi Service', 'Telephone', 'Wake Up Service / Alarm Clock', 'Refrigerator in room', 'Breakfast Available', 'Cable / Satellite TV', 'Clothes Rack', 'First Aid Kit', 'Happy Hour', 'Laptop Safe', 'Outdoor Dining Area', 'Parking Garage', 'Patio', 'Portuguese', 'Private Bathrooms', 'Radio', 'Sun Deck', 'Tile / Marble Floor', 'Umbrella', 'Valet Parking', 'Wardrobe / Closet', 'Beach Access']","801 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33139-5807",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34439-d240167-Reviews-The_Tony_Hotel_South_Beach-Miami_Beach_Florida.html,240167,1 (305) 677-8722,"Frequently Asked Questions about The Tony Hotel South Beach

Requiring two years of meticulous workmanship, the Inn has now been restored to its original Victorian splendor. Built in 1836, the Fort Conde Inn (Hall-Ford House) is Mobile’s second oldest house and its interior and exterior finishes reflect its architectural vintage from original heart pine flooring and custom-milled stairways, moldings, and window and door trim to marble fireplace mantles, plaster walls, 12 foot ceilings and crystal chandeliers. The Fort Conde Inn, located in Mobile's historic Fort Conde Village, has recently expanded to include four newly restored hisorically certified homes: The Antunez House, the Spear-Barter House, as well as the Blakely and Gonzalez cottages. Walking into the Inn today, is like taking a step back in time to when these homes were originally built. The Inn sits on a quiet street in Fort Conde Village surrounded by Victorian homes restored with integrity and respect for their architectural heritage. It is situated adjacent to Fort Conde, a pre-revolutionary war fort built by the French in 1720 and named after the Prince of Conde, a grandson of Luis XIV. Mobile was founded by the French and the fort protected Mobile from incursions by the British. In recognition of the French heritage of this land, the rooms at the Inn have been named in French after friends and family members of the owner.","['Internet', 'Free Internet', 'Free parking', 'Wifi', 'Free Wifi', 'Suites', 'Wheelchair access', 'Kitchenette', 'Non-smoking rooms', 'Air conditioning', 'Non-smoking hotel', 'Flatscreen TV', 'Breakfast Available', 'Housekeeping', 'English', 'Complimentary Toiletries', 'Hair Dryer', 'Outdoor Furniture', 'Shared Lounge / TV Area', 'Street Parking', 'Telephone', 'Wake Up Service / Alarm Clock', 'Family Rooms', 'Safe', 'Bottled Water', 'Breakfast in the Room', 'Bridal Suite', 'Newspaper', 'Special Diet Menus', 'Wine / Champagne']","165 Saint Emanuel St, Mobile, AL 36602-3006",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g30709-d2306776-Reviews-Fort_Conde_Inn-Mobile_Alabama.html,2306776,2514055040,"Frequently Asked Questions about Fort Conde Inn

The Lowell continues to be the most highly ranked hotel in New York City. The hotel was awarded the designation as the #1 Hotel in NYC from 2019 Travel + Leisure World’s Best Awards for the second year in a row, along with being recognized in the Condé Nast Traveler Readers’ Choice Awards as the #1 Hotel in NYC. The Lowell has been named the #1 Best Hotel in New York, the #1 Best Hotel in New York City and ranked #12 of the 50 Best Hotels in the USA 2020 by U.S. News & World Report in their annual Best Hotels rankings. Majorelle was bestowed the #1 spot for restaurant décor from Zagat’s New York City Restaurant Guide. Established in 1927, The Lowell reflects the timeless elegance and soul of the Upper East Side. The warmth of a familiar smile, attention to detail and discreet service welcome discerning guests as they move through chic classical spaces. Wood-burning fireplaces—a rare find in New York—landscaped terraces with sweeping city views are enjoyed in many of the sun-filled rooms and suites fashioned in the hotel’s distinctive style with the refined comforts of a private apartment. Legendary restaurateur Charles Masson oversees the property’s newest dining additions where guests come to escape the bustle of the city over seasonal cuisine at Majorelle and linger over the perfect martini at Jacques Bar. The Club Room at The Lowell offers a sophisticated setting to unwind, while the reimagined Pembroke Room upholds tradition with its beloved breakfast and afternoon tea.","['Pets Allowed', 'Room service', 'Restaurant', 'Kitchenette', 'Internet', 'Free Internet', 'Wifi', 'Free Wifi', 'Non-smoking rooms', 'Fitness center', 'Dry Cleaning', 'Laundry Service', 'Concierge', 'Multilingual Staff', 'Suites', 'Public Wifi', 'Air conditioning', 'Refrigerator in room', 'Minibar', 'Flatscreen TV', 'Housekeeping', 'Doorperson', 'Wheelchair access', 'Airport transportation', 'Meeting rooms', 'Business center', 'Non-smoking hotel', 'Safe', 'Parking', 'Air Purifier', 'Allergy-free Room', 'Arabic', 'Baggage Storage', 'Bath / Shower', 'Bathrobes', 'Bicycle Rental', 'Blackout Curtains', 'Bottled Water', 'Breakfast in the Room', 'Cable / Satellite TV', 'Car Hire', 'Chinese', 'Coffee / Tea Maker', 'Danish', 'Desk', 'Dining Area', 'Dishwasher', 'Dutch', 'Electric Kettle', 'English', 'Filipino', 'Fireplace', 'Complimentary Toiletries', 'Complimentary Welcome Drink', 'French', '24-Hour Front Desk', 'German', 'Hair Dryer', 'Highchairs Available', 'Hindi', 'Hungarian', 'Interconnected room(s) available', 'Ironing Service', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Landmark View', 'Newspaper', 'Norwegian', 'On-Demand Movies', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Private Bathrooms', 'Paid Private Parking Nearby', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Seating Area', '24-Hour Security', 'Shoeshine', 'Spanish', 'Swedish', 'Telephone', 'Thai', 'Tile / Marble Floor', 'Valet Parking', 'Wake Up Service / Alarm Clock', 'Walk-in Shower', 'Wardrobe / Closet', 'Wine / Champagne']","28 E 63rd St, New York City, NY 10065-8088",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93585-Reviews-Lowell_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html,93585,1 (646) 933-8227,"Frequently Asked Questions about Lowell Hotel
